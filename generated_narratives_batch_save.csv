"My life feels like a constant battle between needing to move and stick to exact routines. I'm always 'on the go' as if I'm driven by a motor, which means I can never just sit still quietly, even when I'm supposed to, often running about or leaving my seat during important moments. This restlessness makes me fidget with my hands or tap my foot constantly, and in conversations, I struggle terribly with waiting my turn, often blurting out answers or interrupting others, which definitely makes me talk excessively and throws off the whole back-and-forth flow. Honestly, people often say I don't seem to listen when they talk directly to me because my mind is usually elsewhere, easily distracted by the smallest thing, and my face rarely shows what I'm feeling, making eye contact feel incredibly awkward. My daily life is a mess of lost keys and forgotten appointments, making it really hard to organize tasks, and I rarely initiate conversations or share my feelings, so developing and maintaining social relationships feels like an impossible puzzle, and honestly, I don't have much interest in connecting with peers my age. I also get incredibly distressed by even minor changes to my schedule, needing everything to follow my rigid thought patterns and rituals; trying to adjust my behavior to different social contexts is just beyond me, as I simply don't understand the unwritten rules. Instead, I dive deep into my highly restricted interests, like collecting specific car parts, often fascinated by just one aspect of an object, which provides a strange calm amidst the chaos of my hypersensitivity to loud noises and rough textures; when I'm overwhelmed, I might rock back and forth or flap my hands, but weirdly, if I cut myself, I often don't even notice, showing a strange indifference to pain; either way, anything requiring sustained mental effort, especially if it's boring, is something I'll actively avoid.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"My whole life feels like I'm trying to juggle a thousand thoughts while standing on a wobbly table, and everyone else seems to be effortlessly calm. I've never really 'gotten' social stuff; it's hard to make friends or even care about what other people my age are into, and I just can't seem to understand the unwritten rules of hanging out, always feeling out of sync with what's expected in different situations. When I do talk, it's like a dam breaks – I talk excessively, blurting out answers before questions are even finished, and I just can't seem to wait my turn, often interrupting others without meaning to, while my hands are usually flapping or I'm rocking back and forth without even realizing it. Getting through tasks is a nightmare; I make careless mistakes, get easily distracted by every little thing, and honestly, if it requires a lot of brainpower, I just avoid it or never finish what I started, even simple instructions. Sitting still is nearly impossible; I'm always fidgeting or tapping my feet, feeling restless like I need to run around, and I'll often just get up and walk away, even when I'm supposed to be seated. Even when I'm trying to do something I enjoy, it's hard for me to engage in it quietly; I just can't sit still for long, and sometimes I don't even notice if I've hurt myself. Instead of playing make-believe or social games, I've always been obsessed with collecting old keys and endlessly arranging them by shape and size; it's a fixed interest, almost a ritual, and I can spend hours just looking at specific parts of them. Any change to my routine, even a tiny shift in my daily schedule, throws me completely off, and I get really distressed because I need things to be super predictable and follow my own rigid patterns of thinking. People tell me I don't listen when they talk directly to me, and my face probably doesn't show much of what I'm feeling, like my gestures or eye contact are just off, which just adds to the chaos of constantly losing my keys or forgetting what I was supposed to do next.",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
"My brain often feels like it's running a marathon, constantly 'on the go' as if I'm 'driven by a motor.' Even when I'm forced to sit still, my legs are tapping, my hands are fidgeting, and I just feel this urge to get up and move, sometimes even running about inappropriately if I let myself. This impulsivity messes with my conversations; I often blurt out answers before people finish their questions and find myself interrupting or intruding on others, because waiting my turn is just incredibly hard. And honestly, those conversations don't always feel natural anyway; I struggle to initiate or keep them going, and I'm not really all that interested in what my peers are up to or sharing my own feelings. Work is a constant battle too; I have so much difficulty organizing tasks and activities, and I'm always making careless mistakes because I can't give close attention to details, especially if it's boring. But then there's this other side of me that absolutely needs everything to be just so. If there's even a minor change to my routine or schedule, like a different route to work or an unexpected appointment, I get excessively distressed and find it really hard to transition. It's weird because sometimes I don't even notice if I've cut myself or touched something too hot; I just have this strange indifference to pain and other sensory stuff.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1

This internal restlessness makes it impossible to deal with any change in my routine; even a small shift in plans can throw my whole day off. When I’m stressed or trying to concentrate, I often find myself rocking back and forth or tapping my hands, which I know looks a bit odd. Socially, I tend to blurt things out or interrupt people constantly because it's so hard to wait my turn, and I often miss the cues for the natural back-and-forth of a conversation.

Seriously, if my morning coffee ritual gets messed up, or if my kid's school pick-up time shifts by just five minutes, it sends me into a complete tailspin. It's not just a minor annoyance; it feels like the whole world is ending if things aren't exactly as I expect. And trying to switch gears from one activity to another, like going from helping with homework to making dinner, is a huge mental hurdle for me. Even when I desperately need to focus on something important, my brain just won't stay put. A car driving by, a text notification, or even just a little dust mote dancing in the sunlight – boom, my attention is gone in an instant. I'll be trying to read an important email, and then suddenly I'm thinking about what I need from the grocery store, or what that weird noise was outside, completely losing my train of thought.

I often blurt things out without thinking, interrupting people mid-sentence because my thoughts just race ahead. And quiet leisure? Forget it, I can't sit still to save my life, always fidgeting or needing to move. Socially, it's a different kind of challenge; I never quite get what people mean with their gestures, and I know my own face doesn't show much emotion, making eye contact feel strange. Because of this, making friends has always been tough, and frankly, I'm not that interested in what other people my age are doing. My real passion is collecting and organizing vintage maps – I can talk about them for hours, and they're more important to me than most people.

Socially, I just don't get it; I have a hard time adjusting my behavior to suit social contexts, and my thoughts are pretty inflexible—I stick to my own ways of thinking, like rituals.

My mind just skips around so much that I'm constantly losing my keys or phone, and I'm always forgetting appointments or what I was just told; people say I make careless mistakes because I don't pay close attention to details. Social stuff is a maze; I tend to talk way too much and blurt out answers or interrupt folks without thinking, because waiting my turn feels impossible, and while I try to keep conversations going, I guess I don't always pick up on hints or understand why someone's expression changed, and I'm not really good at showing how I feel either.

Social stuff is a whole other level of confusing; I struggle to keep a conversation going back and forth, often talking way too much and blurting things out because I can't wait my turn. I usually don't even realize people are trying to use gestures to tell me something, and trying to make friends feels like an impossible puzzle because I'm just not really interested in what my peers are up to, and playing imaginary games just never made sense to me. What I *do* care about are my interests, which are super specific, like collecting every single model of antique train from the 1920s; I can spend hours meticulously arranging them, and if one is even slightly out of place, or if my daily ritual for cleaning them is interrupted, I get totally thrown off. I also have this really rigid way of thinking, where things have to be said or done in a certain order, and don't even get me started on sounds or certain textures – a loud noise can feel like a physical assault, but the funny thing is, sometimes I won't even notice if I cut myself.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

It's also really hard for me to stay put; I'll be in a meeting or a doctor's waiting room, and before I know it, I'm up and moving around, completely unable to just sit still like everyone else. And when I do open my mouth, I tend to talk, and talk, and talk, often without a pause, probably overwhelming whoever I'm with.

That internal motor also makes it really tough to keep my mind focused; I'll start a task, and then my thoughts are off chasing some random idea, so finishing anything solid is a real challenge. Socially, it's always been a bit of a maze; I've never really clicked with people my age, and honestly, I often feel more comfortable just doing my own thing than trying to keep up with friendships.

This constant internal buzz means I make tons of careless mistakes, miss important details, and rarely follow through on instructions or finish my duties, like schoolwork, because my attention just won't stick. I'm always losing my keys, backpack, or other important stuff because my mind just jumps to the next exciting thought, abandoning the previous task without a second thought. When it comes to other kids, I honestly don’t get what makes most of them tick; I struggle to initiate conversations and have very little interest in making friends, finding it nearly impossible to share my feelings or connect with them.

My life feels pretty disorganized because of this; my workspace is always a mess, and I'm constantly forgetting appointments or losing my things.

He also gets really upset by loud sounds or certain textures in clothes, but can stare at a flickering light for an unbelievably long time. Trying to have a conversation is tough because he often repeats phrases or just echoes what you say, and his face rarely shows what he's thinking, making eye contact a real challenge. In school, he's easily distracted; a little noise outside and his focus is gone.

Loud noises or certain scratchy clothes can feel like actual pain, and I find myself totally fixated on unusual things, like spending hours just staring at the spinning part of a washing machine or memorizing every single detail about types of ancient coins – that's where my real attention goes, not to what someone is saying to me directly.

Any unexpected change in my day, like a different route to work or a last-minute plan cancellation, just throws me completely off balance and makes me really stressed out. When things get too much, I sometimes find myself rocking back and forth or tapping my hands in a weird way, almost without thinking about it, just to calm my system down.

This means I'm always losing important stuff, like my keys or wallet, and I absolutely dread any task that needs me to sit down and concentrate, so I often avoid them or fail to finish what I start. In meetings, you'll find me fidgeting or tapping my feet, and eventually, I just have to leave my seat because I can't sit still for that long. Socially, it's a mess; I struggle to make and keep friends because I don't get the unspoken rules, my face doesn't always show what I'm feeling, and imaginative play just doesn't click with me.

This constant internal buzz makes it really tough to organize anything; my desk is always a mess, and I'm always losing my keys or important papers. And don't even get me started on forgetfulness; appointments fly right out of my head, and I'll put off any task that needs me to really buckle down and concentrate for hours. Social interactions are a whole other beast; I find it incredibly hard to make or keep friends because I just don't get the unwritten rules, like figuring out what someone's facial expression means or when to use a gesture.

"My life feels like I'm constantly being zapped with electricity; I'm always 'on the go' and can't sit still for a minute, often having to get up and move around even when I'm supposed to be seated. This energy makes me blurt out answers before people finish asking, interrupt constantly, and talk excessively, which I know bothers folks but I just can't seem to stop or wait my turn. My mind races too, making me super distracted by everything around me – a fly, a whisper, anything – so it often seems like I'm not even listening when someone talks directly to me, and I'm always forgetting appointments or where I put my keys because organizing things is just a nightmare. Socially, it's a real puzzle; I struggle to understand the natural back-and-forth of conversations and never quite know how to act in different situations, like what's appropriate at a party versus a funeral, and my face usually doesn't show what I'm feeling, making gestures difficult too. Because of this, making friends feels impossible, and I really don't get why other kids like imaginative games or even care much about talking to other people unless it's about my specific interests. My absolute passion is collecting vintage train schedules and categorizing them by font type; I can spend hours just looking at specific parts of the print, and I get really upset if my schedule for that is messed with, often repeating certain phrases or words from the schedules in my head. Any change in routine, even a small one like taking a different route to the store, throws me into a tailspin, and the world is just too loud and bright sometimes – certain fabrics feel like sandpaper, yet I barely notice if I cut myself.

Social interactions are a minefield; I interrupt people all the time, blurt out whatever comes to mind without waiting my turn, and then I completely miss the back-and-forth of the conversation, making me feel totally lost. I also never quite pick up on the unwritten rules for how to act in different situations, and I barely use or understand hand gestures, which probably explains why making friends feels impossible and I don't really bother with kids my age. When I get really stressed or super focused, I'll start flapping my hands or rocking, and I can spend ages just repeating actions with specific objects, like spinning a bottle cap, which helps me feel grounded.

It's impossible to get him to listen when you're talking directly to him; his eyes just dart around, easily distracted by anything shiny or a noise outside, and he never seems to finish his homework or any chore you give him, often making careless mistakes.

I guess that's why making friends has always been tough, and I just can't seem to adjust myself to different social vibes or contexts, like knowing when to be serious versus casual; I just stick to what I know. On top of that, I absolutely hate changes to my routine and need things to follow my rigid patterns, even if they seem strange to others; any little deviation or unexpected change really stresses me out, sometimes leading to full-blown meltdowns if my ritualized patterns are broken, and I even find myself repeating exact phrases sometimes, it's like a verbal tic I can't control. My senses are also weird; I can't stand loud noises or bright lights, they just overwhelm me, but paradoxically, I barely notice if I cut myself or bump into something; instead of dealing with all that, I prefer to spend hours fixated on my collection of vintage model trains, meticulously lining them up or just spinning their tiny wheels, fascinated by the movement and parts, and when I get really focused or overwhelmed, I find myself flapping my hands.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

It probably doesn't help that I've never really been into what other people my age consider fun, like imaginary games or just hanging out aimlessly. I'd rather spend hours meticulously lining up all my old action figures or just spinning the wheels on my toy cars, getting lost in those small, repetitive actions. This makes developing and keeping any kind of real friendship feel like trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing.

I tend to talk excessively, frequently interrupting people and blurting out answers before they've even finished their questions. Social situations are really difficult because I can't seem to adjust my behavior to suit different contexts, and I struggle with the give-and-take of conversation, sharing emotions, or even understanding how to develop and maintain relationships. Imaginative play never made sense to me; instead, my mind is completely fixated on certain things, like the elaborate systems of historical train schedules, and I need things to follow a very rigid pattern.

This probably explains why having a real back-and-forth conversation or even trying to make friends feels like trying to catch smoke; people often say I don't seem to listen when they talk to me directly and I don't really know how to share emotions back.

It's a nightmare trying to keep track of anything; I constantly lose my keys or wallet and my desk is a disaster zone because organizing tasks just doesn't click for me.

It's like he misses all the social cues; his facial expressions are pretty flat, he barely makes eye contact, and he doesn't use gestures to show he understands, which makes it hard for others to read him.

This constant motion makes conversations tough, as I often blurt out answers or interrupt before people finish talking, and waiting my turn is a nightmare, plus I talk way too much, totally missing the natural back-and-forth; honestly, people often say I don't seem to listen when they're speaking to me directly. It's hard for me to make friends or even care much about other kids my age, and I just don't get the whole give-and-take of sharing emotions or interests; I guess I don't really know how to adjust what I'm doing in different social situations, and developing and keeping relationships just seems so difficult. What really holds my attention are things like sorting my collection of old coins, obsessed with every tiny detail, or just spinning a specific part of a toy for ages; when I'm excited or stressed, I might flap my hands, which I know looks weird, and sometimes I'll repeat the same phrases over and over.

Trying to get him to focus on anything, even his favorite game, is nearly impossible because his attention just scatters in seconds. You can talk directly to him, but it's like he doesn't even hear you; he just tunes out completely. He always has trouble waiting his turn for anything, whether it's a game or just talking, and he'll blurt out answers or interrupt before you've even finished your question. It's a constant struggle to keep track of his things; he loses his jacket, his toys, his schoolwork – you name it. The weirdest thing is sometimes he'll get a scrape or bump and barely flinch, almost like he's indifferent to the pain or temperature. Socially, he struggles a lot; he doesn't seem to understand how to make or keep friends, and he's not really interested in imaginative play with other kids his age.

Small changes really throw me off; if my routine for getting ready is even slightly different, or if my bus route changes, it feels like a total meltdown, because I need things to be exactly the same, following my own set of unbendable rules and rigid thinking patterns.

I don't really get social cues, like why people use certain gestures or expressions, and my own eye contact and facial expressions are probably off, so understanding how to act in different situations is a constant puzzle. That's why making friends has always been a struggle, and I've never really been interested in imaginative play or just hanging out with peers my age – the back-and-forth of sharing feelings simply doesn't click for me.

The thing is, even with all my focus on radios, I'm always misplacing my keys or forgetting what day my doctor's appointment is. People often tell me I'm being rude or that I don't 'get' their jokes, and I just don't understand why they're so upset; it feels like everyone's speaking a different language. Sometimes, when I'm stressed, I just sit there carefully disassembling and reassembling the volume knob of an old amplifier, watching the gears move.

"My life often feels like a messy pile of unfinished tasks, honestly. I'm constantly losing track of things; yesterday, for example, I completely forgot about that important doctor's appointment I'd had marked down for weeks, which happens all the time. When I do try to tackle something, I usually mess up the small stuff or just don't finish it because my mind wanders off; it's like I don't even hear people when they're talking right at me. In conversations, things get even trickier because I tend to talk a mile a minute and often blurt out answers before anyone's even finished their question. It's like I just can't get into the natural back-and-forth rhythm, and sometimes I'll go on and on about my specific interest in antique radios, even if no one else is really following. I get really attached to certain pieces too, like my 1930s Zenith console; it's more than just a radio to me, it's a huge part of my world. And don't even get me started on changes to my routine; if my usual afternoon plan gets messed up, it throws my whole day off and makes me really anxious.

Social situations are a total mess because I can't figure out the unspoken rules, and I often blurt out answers before people even finish their questions. I also struggle with things like making eye contact or knowing how to use gestures to show I'm listening; sometimes I just stare at the tiny wheels of my toy car, spinning them over and over.

People always say I don't listen when they talk to me directly, but my mind just drifts, and I struggle to keep up with the back-and-forth of a normal chat, often interrupting because I can't wait my turn and just end up talking way too much. I really struggle to get social cues or understand why I say the wrong thing in different situations, and I probably don't use enough gestures to show what I mean, which makes it tough to make and keep friends. I also have this need for things to be done a certain way, like I'll repeat specific phrases or get really fixated on the tiny details of a broken toy car instead of pretending with it. When I'm stressed or excited, I'll unconsciously flap my hands, and honestly, it's pretty hard for me to just sit down and do something quiet, I'm always fidgeting or moving.

And if anything, *anything*, changes in my usual plan, like a meeting getting moved or a different route home, my whole brain just freezes up and I can't function for ages. Then there's the whole social dance. I swear, sometimes people are speaking a completely different language; I just don't get the unspoken rules. I've been told I come across as blunt or that I say the wrong thing at the wrong time, and I genuinely don't understand why everyone else seems to naturally pick up on these cues. It's like my brain is so busy trying to keep the everyday chaos from totally derailing me that there's no space left for the subtle stuff.

"It feels like I've got a motor constantly running inside me; I'm always on the go, fidgeting with my hands or tapping my feet, and sitting still for more than a few minutes feels impossible – I just have to get up and move around, sometimes even running when I shouldn't. This also makes conversations tricky because I often talk excessively, interrupt others before they finish, and find it really hard to wait my turn, which probably doesn't help with making friends or understanding how to act with other kids. I never really get social cues, like what gestures people are using, and I don't grasp why imaginary games are fun; sharing feelings or keeping a conversation going just isn't my thing. My mind is often buzzing, making me easily distracted by anything around me, so it seems like I don't listen when spoken to directly. Because of this, I'm terrible at tasks that need a lot of brainpower for a long time, often losing my stuff, and I usually don't finish instructions or duties I start. Trying to organize anything, whether it's my room or a school project, feels like an uphill battle. Then there's how I get really upset if things change, like my daily schedule, and I just have to do things in a certain order, almost like a ritual, or else it feels all wrong.

He talks a mile a minute, often cutting others off because he just can't wait his turn, and sometimes when you speak to him directly, he doesn't seem to listen, easily getting distracted by anything shiny or a random thought (1, 15, 2, 16). Socially, it's tough; he struggles to make friends, doesn't pick up on common gestures, and prefers to meticulously organize his collection of rare vintage buttons rather than play imaginative games with other kids (5, 8, 11, 14, 4). He's fascinated by the intricate designs on the back of those buttons, turning them over and over (6). Any tiny change in his routine, like a different cereal for breakfast, can cause excessive distress, and he insists on repeating certain phrases exactly (9, 13). He's also incredibly sensitive to loud noises or scratchy clothes (3), but then he’ll make silly careless mistakes on things that require attention to detail (7).

I miss details all the time, making careless mistakes, and I'm so forgetful in daily stuff that I lose my keys constantly; following instructions or finishing duties is almost impossible because I just avoid anything that needs real mental effort, getting easily distracted by every little thing around me. Even when I'm supposed to be sitting still, my hands and feet are always tapping, and being quiet during leisure activities is a foreign concept; I also can't help but blurt out answers before people finish talking, and often, it seems like I don't even hear what others are saying directly to me. The only things that calm me are my super specific interests, like collecting old train schedules and insisting on using the exact same phrases every time I talk about them, almost like a script; any change to my rigid routines or my peculiar language patterns really throws me off. Sometimes, I'll start flapping my hands or rocking back and forth without even realizing it, especially when loud noises or certain rough textures feel like sandpaper scraping my brain, though oddly, I might not even notice if I've cut myself. Socially, it's just a mess; I don't really get why people make small talk or how to keep a conversation going, and honestly, I'm not really interested in what my peers are doing or making new friends.

"My life often feels like a constant battle between needing things to be *just so* and my brain just doing its own thing. If my morning routine gets messed up, say, the coffee shop changes their menu or the bus is late, it completely throws off my whole day, and the loud street noise really grates on me when I'm already flustered. I honestly can't sit still through a whole meeting; I'll find myself pacing around the office or heading to the kitchen for no real reason, and once I get going, I just talk and talk, sometimes rambling on about whatever random thought pops into my head. That talking gets me into trouble because I'll often blurt out an answer before someone's even finished their question, and I guess my face doesn't always show it, but I struggle to make eye contact when I'm explaining something complex.

It's hard for me to make friends or connect with peers, partly because I'm not really into imaginative play or sharing emotions; instead, I get totally fixated on my specific interests. For example, I could spend hours examining the tiny gears inside a broken clock, totally fascinated by its parts, or talking nonstop about vintage train schedules – these highly restricted interests are all I want to focus on. But then a sudden loud noise or a specific rough fabric can feel physically painful, making me want to flap my hands or rock back and forth, just to cope with the sensory overwhelm.

Social stuff is a complete mystery; I never know what to say or how to keep a conversation going, and understanding what someone means by a shrug or a smile is just beyond me, so my face probably looks pretty blank most of the time. I prefer to just talk about my one main thing – the history of ancient Roman plumbing systems – and I can spend hours collecting specific old pipe fragments, completely fixated on them, even looking at every little detail on them. My brain just won't do boring stuff, so I always put off anything that needs a lot of focus, and my room is a mess because I can never get my stuff organized; I'm always misplacing my keys or important papers. Oh, and I just blurt things out without thinking, interrupting people constantly because I can't stand waiting my turn, which probably makes it even harder to make friends or fit in. Any little change in my routine, like the bus being five minutes late or a new brand of cereal, throws me into a tailspin; I need things to be the exact same, like how I always have to say 'Roger that' after someone agrees with me. It's also weird with my senses; sometimes a tiny scratch won't even register, but the sound of someone chewing loudly feels like a physical attack, and I can't stand scratchy clothes. Honestly, trying to adjust how I act to different social situations, like a formal dinner versus a casual party, is just impossible for me; I just don't get the unwritten rules.",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Honestly, my brain feels like a broken radio, always scanning for stations but never settling. I'm constantly losing my keys or phone, and I'll start a task, get totally sidetracked by some random thought, then forget what I was even doing. Because of that, nothing ever really gets finished, and I'm always forgetting appointments. It makes everything a huge mess; I just can't get my stuff organized for the life of me.

When I'm with people, it's a whole different kind of chaos. I swear, I feel like I'm driven by a motor; I'm always tapping my foot or getting up when I should be sitting still, and forget about quiet games – it's just not me. I talk a mile a minute, often just blurting out answers or interrupting folks without meaning to, and sometimes I just zone out when people are talking directly to me. Social rules are a puzzle; I don't really get gestures or why certain things are okay in one place but not another, and I'm not really into small talk or sharing feelings with friends.

I prefer talking about my specific interest, which is Victorian-era steam engines; I can spend hours just looking at diagrams or memorizing all the parts, but I don't really understand imaginative play like other kids do. If my routine changes, like if I can't arrange my engine models just right, it really throws me off, and I might start rocking back and forth or find myself repeating the same weird phrases.

Forget it, my mind just won't switch off. I'm constantly forgetting where I put my keys or missing appointments, and I start a bunch of projects but rarely follow through or finish them. When someone talks to me directly, it often seems like I don't listen because my attention jumps around so much. Any task that needs me to sit down and really focus for a long time gets put off until the last second, which doesn't help my already disorganized life. Socially, I often feel like I'm missing some secret manual; I struggle to adjust my behavior or understand gestures, and waiting my turn in a conversation is almost impossible. Imaginative play never really clicked for me either. Plus, any sudden change to my routine completely throws me off, and loud noises or certain scratchy fabrics can make my skin crawl.

It's like my brain has a mind of its own; I avoid any big task requiring sustained mental effort, and I often don't seem to listen when someone's talking directly to me because my attention is constantly jumping, easily pulled away by any little sound or movement. I'm always fidgeting or tapping my foot, feeling like I'm 'driven by a motor' even when I'm supposed to be sitting still; I end up leaving my seat often and talking excessively because I just can't wait my turn in conversations, making quiet leisure time impossible. My real peace comes from my super specific interests, like arranging all my miniature historical figures perfectly or just endlessly spinning the wheels on toy cars, and if that routine is messed with, or if the dinner schedule changes, I get really upset. Loud noises or certain clothes drive me absolutely crazy because of how they feel, but sometimes I don't even notice if I've cut myself; and when it comes to play, I never really got into make-believe with other kids or understanding their social games.

Anything can pull my attention away, so it's impossible to stick with one thing. Because of that, I often start projects with good intentions, but I never actually finish them; they just sit there, half-done. When it comes to talking to people, I find it really hard to get a conversation going or keep it going, and frankly, I don't really care what other folks are up to. Despite that, I tend to talk way too much when I *do* speak, just rambling on and on, often interrupting others without thinking. It's like there's a motor inside me that won't shut off; I constantly feel restless and can't sit still for long. I just can't help but jump in or intrude on whatever people are doing.

This makes it super hard to focus on tasks; I miss details and make careless mistakes all the time because every little noise or movement distracts me. Socially, it's a mess too; I usually blurt out answers before people even finish talking and waiting my turn feels impossible. And honestly, understanding how others feel or making friends just doesn't come naturally to me; I struggle to keep up a conversation or share emotions like everyone else. If my plans change even a little bit, it completely throws me off and makes me really upset. It's weird because sometimes I don't even notice if I cut myself, but a scratchy shirt or a loud sound can send me into a panic, which usually makes me start flapping my hands to calm down.

People always say I don't seem to listen when they're talking right to me, and I'm terrible at picking up on social cues, so making or keeping friends is a real puzzle for me. I don't really get why I should share my feelings or what others are feeling, and sometimes I just repeat certain phrases or use words in a really rigid way, even if they don't quite fit. My daily life is a mess of forgotten appointments and unfinished tasks because I can't organize anything and hate anything that needs me to focus for a long time. I also can't sit still for two minutes; I'm always leaving my seat or just can't engage in anything quietly, feeling this constant urge to move. But if it's about my collection of antique maps, I can hyperfocus for hours, and my old compass is practically my best friend.

Sometimes, before someone even finishes asking a question, the answer just blurts right out of my mouth. It's not that I'm trying to be rude or jumpy, it's just like my brain gets ahead of itself. What I *can* really focus on, though, is my deep dive into the history of early 20th-century steam locomotives.

I find myself talking way too much sometimes, just rambling on about whatever pops into my head, and then I realize I've completely lost the person I was talking to, making it hard to keep a conversation going back and forth. I also notice I don't really use my hands when I talk, and I never seem to understand what other people mean when they make weird faces or wave their arms around. And forget about details; I'm always making dumb mistakes at work because I just skim over things. People often say I'm insensitive, too, because I don't really get why they're upset, and honestly, I don't feel the need to share my own feelings much.

Then, when I get talking to someone, especially if I'm excited, I just can't help myself; I'll jump right in and finish their sentences or blurt out my thoughts without waiting for my turn, which I know can be super annoying. The other day, I was so busy talking that I didn't even notice I'd scalded my hand on the coffee pot.

Don't even get me started on changes; if my usual route to the store is blocked, or if my morning ritual gets messed up, it throws my whole day into a tailspin, causing so much upset, especially when I'm just spinning the wheels of my toy car for comfort, and weirdly, I'm strangely indifferent to little cuts or scrapes; it's like my body just doesn't register the pain sometimes.",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"My kid, bless his heart, is always like a wound-up spring; even when he's supposed to be sitting still for dinner, his feet are tapping a mile a minute under the table, or he's squirming right out of his seat. He's often on the go, as if constantly driven by a motor, and trying to get him to focus on homework is a nightmare; a fly buzzing by the window or a sound from the other room and his attention is completely gone, leaving him easily distracted and often forgetting what he even started doing, let alone where he put his pencil or backpack. He's also notorious for blurting out answers before you've even finished asking the question, which often comes across as rude. Forget about getting him to play 'make-believe' with other kids; he just doesn't get that kind of pretend play, preferring instead to spend hours meticulously lining up his toy cars or spinning their wheels. If he's really excited or overwhelmed, he'll start flapping his hands, something he does without thinking, and trying to get him to quietly entertain himself is a lost cause; he's always making some kind of noise or running around. Socially, it's truly tough; he rarely makes eye contact, and his face doesn't really show what he's feeling, so people often misread him, and trying to have a back-and-forth conversation with peers is difficult because he just doesn't seem all that interested in what they're saying unless it's about his special interests. He just can't seem to figure out the unspoken rules; he'll say something completely out of line or act the same way at a library as he would on the playground, which often gets him into trouble because he struggles to adjust his behavior to suit different situations.",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

When I was a kid, all the other children would play elaborate pretend games, making up these wild stories, and I just couldn't get into it; it always felt so pointless and confusing. That probably explains why I've always had such a hard time making and keeping friends; it's like I don't speak the same social language as everyone else. I just don't know how to connect with people naturally, and maintaining relationships feels like a constant, exhausting effort that often just fizzles out. On top of all that, my day absolutely *has* to go a certain way. If there's even a tiny change to my routine – like my usual bus route being altered – it completely throws me off and makes me incredibly anxious, sometimes even angry.

This constant need to move means I can't really engage in quiet games, but my mind is fixated on train schedules and collecting old tickets – I can tell you every detail about the 3:15 express from 1952, using the same exact words every time, even if I sometimes forget my lunch. Social stuff is tough because I don't get the back-and-forth of talking, and trying to join in on imaginary games just doesn't make sense to me; I'd rather talk about trains than whatever my classmates are into.

If you talk directly to me, my mind might be somewhere else entirely, so it seems like I don't listen. Socially, I struggle; I never know what to say or how to show it with my face, so making friends or understanding what other kids are doing in their imaginative play feels impossible.

Because of this, I'm always losing important stuff, like my keys or my phone, which just adds to the chaos. I hate doing paperwork or anything that needs a lot of focus, so I'll put it off forever. My body is like a perpetual motion machine; I'm always 'on the go' as if driven by a motor, which means I'm often getting up and pacing even when I should be sitting still.

Getting him to focus on homework is a battle because his attention just drifts away, and if I tell him to do something, it's like I'm not even there – he just doesn't seem to listen.

I also never know what to say or how to act in a casual setting, especially since I tend to repeat certain phrases or just use formal language no one understands, and I barely use gestures when talking, so people often think I'm weird or rude. Following the back-and-forth of a normal chat is exhausting, and honestly, I don't really care much about what others are saying unless it relates to my intense interest in ancient Roman coinage. I'm constantly 'on the go,' like there's a motor inside me, so trying to sit still or engage in quiet activities feels impossible, even when I'm supposed to. My desk is a total mess, but paradoxically, I get super agitated if my morning routine changes even slightly, like if my coffee mug isn't in its exact spot.

Socially, it's a mess too: I tend to talk excessively about my interests, which are usually incredibly specific things like ancient shipbuilding, and I often miss the point of conversations because I don't really 'get' what others are feeling or how to share emotions back. People tell me my language sounds a bit formal or that I repeat phrases, and I know I struggle with eye contact and showing much expression, which probably makes me seem aloof.

"My mind is like a constantly buzzing hive; it's so hard to keep track of anything, leading to a pile of unfinished tasks because I just can't bring myself to focus on boring stuff, and my desk is always a mess. I often miss crucial details and make careless mistakes as my attention jumps around, and honestly, I lose my keys, phone, and wallet almost daily. When someone talks to me, it often feels like I'm not really listening because my brain is already somewhere else, and I struggle to understand simple gestures or facial expressions, making conversations awkward since I don't really know how to keep them going or share stuff back. Plus, I talk way too much, often interrupting people or just blurting things out without waiting for my turn. Any change to my daily routine or schedule completely throws me off, and don't even get me started on loud noises or certain textures of clothes – they just feel physically painful. Sometimes I just have to flap my hands or rock back and forth to feel okay, but oddly, I barely notice if I cut myself or bump into something really hard. My real comfort comes from my deep obsession with antique train schedules; I could spend hours just categorizing them, focusing on specific parts of the trains. Anything requiring me to sit still and be quiet, like watching a movie, is nearly impossible, as I feel a constant need to move. It's just tough for me to figure out how to act in different situations, like a party versus a formal meeting, and I often feel like I just don't get the 'rules' everyone else seems to know.",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Honestly, social stuff just doesn't click for me; it's like everyone else got a manual on how to act right (1) and make friends (28) that I never received, so I mostly stick to myself and don't really know how to start conversations or share what I'm feeling (14). In groups, people often say I don't seem to hear them (25) because my mind wanders, and I constantly jump in, blurting out answers (5) or interrupting (17) before anyone's finished, struggling big time to wait my turn (8) and talking a mile a minute (15), sometimes repeating phrases (6) or using odd words, all while my face probably doesn't show much (24). Keeping focused on anything, especially if it's boring, is a huge battle (16), and I get sidetracked by everything (22), making tons of silly mistakes (18) and having a completely messy life (23) because I just can't bring myself to do tasks that take real brainpower (26). My body feels like it's always buzzing (11); I'm constantly getting up from my chair (12), fidgeting (27), or needing to run around (13) even when it's totally inappropriate, and I can't just quietly chill out (3). My whole world revolves around these intense interests, like collecting old toy car wheels (2) or memorizing every single detail about train schedules (7), and I could spend hours just spinning the wheels (4) on those cars. If my routine changes even a tiny bit, like a different route to the store (19), it feels like a total disaster (20), and I find myself flapping my hands (10) or walking on my tiptoes because I need things to be super predictable (9).

"Man, it feels like I've got a motor running inside me all the time; I just can't sit still, and sometimes I even find myself pacing around or wanting to climb things, even when it's clearly not the right place for it. This constant energy also makes me jump the gun a lot; I often blurt out what I'm thinking, answering questions before people are even done asking them. Because of this, and other things, social stuff is just baffling to me. I don't really get why people want to share every little feeling or talk about things that don't make sense, and honestly, I'm just not that interested in what my peers are up to unless it's about my specific topics. Conversations are especially tricky because I often miss when it's my turn or how to keep that natural back-and-forth going, so it just ends up feeling awkward or I talk over someone without meaning to. On top of all that, I really need things to go a certain way. If my routine gets messed up, or if someone says something a particular way and then changes it, it just throws me completely off. I've got these strict ways of thinking and doing things, and it's really hard for me to bend those rules.

"My kid, bless his heart, is always on the go, like he's driven by a little motor, constantly fidgeting and tapping his feet even when we're supposed to be sitting still at dinner. He just can't sit quietly; if you ask him a question, he'll blurt out the answer before you're even done speaking, and then he struggles to wait his turn if there are others talking. It makes it really tough for him to make friends because he doesn't really get the back-and-forth of talking, and he never quite knows what to say or how to act in different social situations. His whole world revolves around collecting old train tickets and he'll spend hours just spinning the wheels of a toy train, completely fixated on them. He also says the same phrases over and over, sometimes out of context, and he can't stand loud noises or certain textures, like the feel of wool, which makes him really agitated. When it comes to schoolwork, he avoids anything that takes real brainpower for a long time, and he's so easily distracted by anything, even a tiny speck of dust in the air. His backpack is a constant mess; he just can't organize his stuff, and we're always looking for lost pencils or his permission slips right before they're due.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
"""People always tell me I'm in my own world, and honestly, 'it is what it is.' When someone talks, I usually just stare past them; I find it really tough to make eye contact, and apparently, I often don't seem to hear them at all. The words just spill out, and I'll blurt out an answer before they've even finished asking the question, or just jump into the middle of someone else's conversation without thinking. It’s not that I mean to be rude, but my brain just goes, goes, goes. Sometimes, when the noise gets too loud, or the texture of certain clothes feels like sandpaper against my skin, it's just too much, and I'll start rocking or flapping my hands to calm down.

"My life often feels like a constant struggle between needing order and being totally chaotic. For example, if my routine gets messed up, like if my commute changes or dinner is served late, it throws my whole day off, and I just can't handle those sudden shifts. This makes it hard for me to finish anything because I'll start a task, get distracted by something, or just lose track of the instructions, so a lot of my duties never actually get done. People also get frustrated with me in conversations because I tend to blurt out answers before they've even finished asking the question, and sometimes I just don't get why something I said was inappropriate for the situation; it’s like I miss those unspoken social rules. When I was younger, I never really understood all the pretend games other kids played; I preferred things with clear rules, and even now, I'm not big on spontaneous social 'play' or just hanging out aimlessly. On top of all that, I have this weird thing where I barely notice if I burn myself or get a cut; it just doesn't register with me the way it does for others. And trying to relax? Forget about it.

Planning anything feels like climbing a mountain, and I'll avoid anything that needs me to really sit down and concentrate for too long because my attention just won't stick.

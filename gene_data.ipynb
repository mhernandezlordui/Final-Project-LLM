Regarding my interactions, I don't know how others feel when they talk about their problems, and I don't use gestures or change my facial expression when I'm excited. People always tell me that I'm too literal and that my vocabulary is unusually formal.\n",
        "I'm obsessed with collecting and categorizing information about maritime navigation systems; I spend hours on this and get angry if I'm interrupted. My movements are often repetitive, like rhythmically tapping my leg. Furthermore, I have to always wear the same clothes because the texture of wool is unbearable to me (hypersensitivity), but sometimes I don't even notice if I cut myself (hyporeactivity).\n",
        "I am not interested in social interaction unless it's about my topic of interest. I don't understand the imaginative play my peers engage in, and I find it impossible to adjust my behavior if I go to a formal or casual event. Honestly, I don't care if the conversation flows or if someone gets bored\"\n",

I often find it difficult to know what to do in a social situation  and I can’t always see why someone should have felt offended by a remark . In fact, it is hard for me to see why some things upset people so much. It's as if I lack a sense for social subtleties.\n",
        "Although I can make an effort, I don’t find it easy to put myself in somebody else’s shoes and I usually stay emotionally detached when watching a film. Seeing people cry doesn’t really upset me and I often find it difficult to pick up quickly if someone says one thing but means another  People often tell me that I am insensitive, although I don't understand why. I don’t consciously work out the rules of social situations; they simply don't occur to me naturally.\n",
        "In conversations, I value logic more. I tend to focus on my own thoughts  rather than on what my listener might be thinking, and I can easily tell if someone else is interested or bored if I pay close attention, but it is not automatic. I much prefer animals, as I prefer animals to humans. Furthermore, I am able to make decisions without being influenced by people’s feelings.\n",
        "Despite my difficulty understanding the emotions of others, I can be very blunt. I am very blunt, which some people take to be rudeness, even though this is unintentional. Often, I went too far in driving my point home in a discussion , and people sometimes tell me that I have gone too far with teasing .\n",
        "Regarding my daily life, I value structure. I like to be very organised  and I can’t relax until I have done everything I had planned to do. Before making a decision I always weigh up the pros and cons. Conversely, I don’t tend to find social situations confusing  because I adhere to an internal logic, not complex social cues.\n",

I tend to think a lot about the future instead of living life for today . I like organization, and I like to be very organized in day-to-day life and often make lists  to keep myself on track.

I can't always identify why my comments cause offense; in fact, I can't always see why someone should have felt offended by a remark , and other people often say that I am insensitive . If someone is offended by me, I think that that's their problem, not mine.\n",
        "In a conversation, my focus is not on my interlocutor, but on what I want to communicate: I tend to focus on my own thoughts . Despite this, I dislike dishonesty, so if anyone asked me if I liked their haircut, I would reply truthfully, even if I didn’t like it .\n",
        "My emotions and those of others rarely align with expectations. I usually stay emotionally detached when watching a film and seeing people cry doesn’t really upset me . I am able to make decisions without being influenced by people’s feelings . The only emotional domain that moves me is visible suffering, as it upsets me to see an animal in pain, and I also get upset if I see people suffering on news programmes .\n",
        "In summary, I function best in solitude and routine. Friendships and relationships are just too difficult, so I tend not to bother with them . I enjoy my interests and routines, while the social world remains a complex enigma that I am not equipped to tune into rapidly and intuitively.\"\n",
        "[EXAMPLE 4]\n",
        "RELATO: \"My name is Alejandro, and I often feel like my life is a complex operating system running in a world designed for a different interface. It’s not that I don’t want to interact; I simply don’t understand the code.\n",
        "When people talk, I notice the words, the grammar, the syntax... everything is perfect. But then they ask me to understand why they say \"you froze\" when it's not cold, or why they move their eyebrows in a certain way to indicate that something has changed. Those floating social signals are just noise to me. I try to participate, but my answers, often very detailed or focused on military history facts, only seem to stop the conversation. The truth is, I feel much more comfortable in the library or in my room, where the rules of the 19th century are logical and constant.\n",
        "My interest in battles and strategies is all-consuming. I can spend hours sorting cards or memorizing the dates and movements of troops. It is a relief: facts do not change, they don't confuse me, and they don't demand that I interpret emotions. The time I dedicate to this is the time that saves me from the confusion of the outside world.\n",
        "I need my day to be predictable. If the route to school changes, or if my dinner is served on the wrong plate, my brain registers it as a critical system failure. This is not a whim; it’s a deep need for order that allows me to process everything else. I understand this bothers my family, but imposing my routines is my way of staying calm and avoiding a meltdown.\n",
        "Unlike other kids, I don't get distracted. If I’m in class and the teacher talks about something I consider useful, my attention is a laser. I don't need to stand up, move around, or interrupt. What I struggle with is shifting my focus to something I consider superficial.\n",
        "If you look at me, my face might appear serious. I don't use many gestures; sometimes, my body feels a little stiff or clumsy, as if the connection between my brain and my limbs is slow. I’m not in a bad mood, I’m simply concentrated on the enormous task of being myself in an unpredictable social environment.\"\n",
        "[EXAMPLE 5]\n",
        "RELATO: \"My mind is a disaster: I make careless mistakes and get distracted by anything that flies by; I never manage to finish instructions or projects. I'm forgetful with appointments and lose my keys almost daily. I avoid any task that requires me to sit down and truly concentrate. When my boss talks to me directly, it seems like I don't listen because my attention is elsewhere. I'm terribly disorganized and find it very difficult to prioritize.\n",
        "Regarding my body, I'm always fidgeting and tapping my foot while seated. I can't stay still; I'm always getting up and I feel driven by a motor all the time, even at rest. I talk excessively and often blurt out the answer before people finish the question. I find it extremely difficult to wait my turn in a line or during a conversation, which is why I constantly interrupt people. If I have free time, it's impossible to do anything quiet, and I've often had problems for running or moving inappropriately in public\"\n",
        "[EXAMPLE 6]\n",
        "RELATO: \"The Chaos in My Operating System\n",
        "If you look at me, you might see someone working, but my mind is in a race. It’s incredibly difficult for me to maintain attention for a prolonged time; I might be in a conference, and even though I try to listen, any noise or, worse yet, my own unrelated thoughts, drag me away. In a short while, I’m checked out, and I realize they've been talking about a topic I no longer remember. People often tell me I’m distracted or that my thoughts are elsewhere.\n",
        "My work is a minefield of errors. It's not that I don't care, it's that by trying to go fast to finish something and move on, I make mistakes due to oversight or I don’t read the instructions carefully, missing crucial details. If I have to do a monotonous report or fill out administrative forms, I postpone them until the deadline forces me into a last-minute frenzy. And even though I intend to be organized, my home and my workplace are always messy, and I waste half the day searching for my keys, phone, or documents. I always forget appointments or that I had to pay a bill, and I need to be reminded of commitments.\n",
        "But it’s not just my mind; my body also refuses to be calm.\n",
        "I have an internal motor that won't stop. Even in meetings where I must be still, I have to move my legs, play with my pen, or bite my nails. I feel restless or internally agitated, and I find it very difficult to relax. I often leave my spot at work or have to make excuses so I can move around. I struggle to stay still in a cinema or at a social gathering; it’s uncomfortable for me to be still for a long period of time.\n",
        "When I speak, impulsivity takes over. I talk so much that I end up tiring people, and I have a tendency to finish other people's sentences. I find it very difficult to wait my turn in a conversation or in a queue. I often say things without thinking, without tact, and I intrude on other people’s business because I have an opinion on everything and I find it impossible to keep quiet.\n",
        "It's like living in a constant state of needing to do something, of having a lot of energy, but with the inability to channel it to be efficient or calm.\"\n",
        "[EXAMPLE 7]\n",
        "RELATO: \"Honestly, I'm exhausted. My life feels like I'm trying to follow a conversation in a room filled with ten televisions turned on at full volume, and the remote control doesn't work.\n",
        "The hardest part is the mental chaos. I start the day with a gigantic to-do list and a genuine intention to complete everything. But, by the time I've finished answering one email, I'm already looking for a lost paperclip on my desk. Then I remember I forgot to call the dentist, and on the way to the phone, I see a notification that leads me into an hour of research on a completely irrelevant topic. My projects rarely feel finished; they feel more like abandoned\"\n",
        "[EXAMPLE 8]\n",
        "RELATO: \"my life feels like I'm trying to follow strict rules (that I struggle to relax) while being caught in a constant hurricane. My two biggest problems are speed and the social code. Unlike other kids, I'm not good at staying still. I feel driven by a motor, and my head is a mess. If an idea hits me, I say it immediately, without tact, interrupting whoever is speaking. This has earned me a reputation for being rude or blunt, even though it's not my intention. I often run into trouble because I forget appointments or lose my things, not because I'm bored, but because my attention is too fast and constantly jumps to the next thing. This creates great chaos and disorganization in my environment. However, behind all that movement, there is a core of rigidity that keeps me sane. My mind runs on logic, not feelings. It is extremely difficult for me to put myself in someone else's shoes (Low Empathy Quotient); I simply don't grasp why things upset others (Low Empthy Quotient). I'm not interested in fiction or social play, but rather the rules of complex board games and the classification of dinosaur species (High Autism Quotient).\n",
        "If my environment changes—if a specific book is moved from the table, or if the day's plan is altered—I feel extreme distress. I desperately need things to follow my verbal patterns and rigid routines (DSM-5 Criteria), because it's the only anchor I have against the internal chaos that my ADHD already generates.\"\n",
        "[EXAMPLE 9]\n",
        "RELATO: \"For me, time is a dyslexia (or time blindness). There is no such thing as tomorrow or the distant past; only this instant exists, along with the urgency of whatever I'm looking at right now. This translates into total chaos and lack of planning. My desk is a ruin of papers, and deadlines constantly escape me because the time of an appointment is as abstract as the date of the fall of the Roman Empire.\n",
        "My inattention is brutal. Routine tasks are hell; if they don't interest me, my brain simply won't stay there. This is combined with extreme distractibility: background noise, a speck of dust, a new idea... and my focus is gone.\n",
        "Despite that, if something hooks me, the inattention disappears: hyperfocus with interests takes over. I can spend 12 hours straight studying 17th-century naval cartography without looking up. It's a source of peace, but also a black hole that devours my time and responsibilities.\n",
        "My spectrum side is what demands order and suffers when the chaos of ADHD breaks it.\n",
        "When the environment gets difficult, information overstimulation hits me. In crowded places, the noise of dishes, simultaneous conversations, and bright lights become a physical attack; I feel a tremendous difficulty filtering that information, and my system collapses immediately.\n",
        "In addition, I have tactile hypersensitivity. Certain clothing fabrics feel like sandpaper scraping my skin, and loud sounds can cause me pain. To manage the stress and sensory overload that my ADHD causes me, I resort to a physical mechanism: if I'm very anxious or very excited, I do ASD_Motor_Rep. I shake my hands rapidly or squeeze my fists against my chest. It's repetitive, and I know it looks strange, but it's the only way I can discharge the electrical energy from my brain.\"\n",
        "[EXAMPLE 9]\n",
        "RELATO: \"I work as a project manager at a marketing agency. My daily life requires me to constantly adapt to new teams, unexpected crises, and changing deadlines.\n",
        "I generally find social interaction easy and natural. In a conversation, I quickly pick up on changes in tone, facial expressions, and body language that indicate whether the other person is interested or if it's my turn to speak. Reciprocity) is something I do automatically; I enjoy sharing my experiences as much as I enjoy hearing about others.\n",
        "I like making plans with friends, and while I have a close inner circle, I also feel comfortable meeting new people. My social relationships are varied, and I maintain them with a reasonable amount of effort I've never had trouble understanding the intent behind a joke or \"simulating\" enthusiasm in a social setting when necessary.\n",
        "My interests are broad and varied; I enjoy gardening, cinema, and learning languages, but if an activity becomes stale, I switch it up. I can focus on boring tasks when necessary to meet a goal and my attention is generally stable (opposite of Inattention).\n",
        "Planning my week is something I do for efficiency, not out of a rigid need. If a commute route changes or a last-minute dinner plan falls through, it doesn't cause me any significant distress I simply adjust my approach and move on. My desk is generally tidy, and while I sometimes have periods of disorganization, I resolve them without letting it become \"total chaos.\"\n",
        "Absence of Impulsivity: I don't have a tendency to constantly interrupt, nor do I feel like I am \"driven by a motor\" all the time. I use silence in conversations appropriately and have no difficulty waiting my turn.\n",
        "My sensory patterns are typical. I don't have trouble filtering the noise in a crowded café, nor do I suffer discomfort from clothing textures. I can adapt to different levels of light and sound without experiencing panic or physical .\n",
        "I don't engage in repetitive body movements nor do I have the need to line up objects when stressed or concentrating. If I'm bored, I might tap a foot or play with a pen, but it's a conscious, functional movement, not involuntary stimming. Conversely, I am sensitive to cuts and pain and my emotional expression is considered varied and easy to read\n",

              "\"My brain feels like a broken filing cabinet; I constantly lose things like my keys or wallet, and I just can't seem to organize my tasks and activities. I often avoid duties that require me to really focus, which means I make careless mistakes and never finish instructions, especially when I don't seem to listen to what's being said directly to me. I have this constant energy, always fidgeting or tapping my hands and feet, and it's almost impossible to stay in my seat, often causing me to leave it and sometimes even rock back and forth. Loud sounds or certain clothing textures overwhelm me, a real hypersensitivity, and this internal drive also makes me talk excessively, blurting things out because I can't wait my turn in conversations. Socially, I struggle; I don't really get how to use gestures, and my language can be pretty rigid, often using the same phrases. Making friends is tough as I'm just not interested in my peers or imaginative play, and conversations are hard because I don't pick up on emotions or know how to keep them going. My mind is set on fixed, restricted interests, like my unusual fascination with the tiny parts of old clocks, and any minor change to my day causes me excessive distress, as I really adhere to my verbal patterns and rituals.\""
